<h1>terms of use</h1>
<h2>you agree to be good and nice to others, even while being critical! be humble. have an open mind. and do not break any law of the land. you agree that your right to a viewpoint ends where the others' right to have their own begins! have fun. keep coming back to read these terms of use as they may change without notice (the 'have fun' part will stay!)</h2>
